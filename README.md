### A wot?
For the uninitiated, a MUD is a Multi-User Dungeon. Think text-based adventure game, but as an online multiplayer game
### And you want to stick that on Discord?
Absolutely. Discord has some really neat functionality that would actually integrate pretty well with the structure of a general MUD. 
### How far is this going? Your own MUD, or can other people use it?
The license on this baby is copyleft af, anyone can use it, but they also have to copyleft it. So yeah, the dream is to make a modular bot that can take hand-crafted modules of code and run a MUD with them. This bot is merely the skeleton on which to drape the flesh of world-building.
### In 6 months??
Granted, we'll predominantly work on just making it a single use MUD, but hopefully be able to make sure tidbits have enough modularity that someone else could add-on to it.
### Ok. How do I run it?
